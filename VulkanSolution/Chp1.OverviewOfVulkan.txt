1. What is Vulkan
Vulkan is very verbose and somewhat fragile. For example, OpenGL does a lot of tasks instead of developer's state. However, Vulkan need to do state tracking, synchronization, and memory management by myself.

verbose -> I need to do an awful lot of work
fragile -> incorrect usage of the API might lead to graphical corruption or even program crash where I would have received a helpful error message.
What I can get -> more control over the device, a clean threading model, much higher performance.

2. Instances, Devices, and Queues

Application	- Instances	- Physical Devices	- Logical Devices	- Queues

Instance is a software consturct that logically separates the state of my application from other applications or libraries running within the context of my application

A physical device represents a single piece of hardware or a collection of hardware that is interconnected.

A logical device is created by the instance. It is a software construct around a physical device and represents a reservation of resources associated with a particular physical device.
