Chapter 3. Queues and Commands

What you will learn in this chapter

```
1. What a queue is and how to use it.
2. How to create commands and send them to Vulkan.
3. How to ensure that a devices has finished processing your work.
```

Vulkan devices expose multiple queues that perform work.
In this chapter, we discuss the varous queue types and explain how to submit work to them in the form of command buffers.
We also show how to instruct a queue to complete all of the work you've sent it.

1. Device Queues

Each device in Vulkan has one or more queues.
The queue is the part of the device that actually performs work.
It can be thought of as a subdevice that exposes a subset of the device's functionality.
In some implementations, each queue may even be a physically separatepart of the system.

Queues are grouped into one or more 'queue families', each containing one or more queues.
Queues within a single family are esssentially identical.
Their capabilities are the same, their performance level and access to system resources is the same, and there is no cost (beyond synchronization) of transferring work between them.
If a device contains multiple cores that have the same capabilities but differ in performance, access to memory, or some other factor that might mean they cannot operate identically,
	it may expose them in separate families that otherwise appear identical.

As discussed in Chapter 1, "Overveiw of Vulkan", you can query the properties of each of a physical device's queue families by calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties().
This function writes the properties of the queue family into an instance of the VkQueueFamilyProperties structure that you hand it.

The number and type of queues that you wish to use must be specified when you create the device.
As you saw in Chapter 1, "Overview of Vulkan", the VkDeviceCreateInfo structure that you pass to vkCreateDevice() contains the 'queueCreateInfoCount' and 'pQueueCreateInfos' members.
Chapter 1, "Overview of Vulkan", glossed over them, but now it's time to fill them in.
The 'queueCreateInfoCount' member contains the number of VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures stored in the array pointed to by 'pQueueCreateInfos'.
The definition of the VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure is
```
typedef struct VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo
{
	VkStructureType							sType;
	const void*									pNext;
	VkDeviceQueueCreateFlags		flags;
	uint32_t										queueFamilyIndex;
	uint32_t										queueCount;
	const float*									pQueuePriorities;
} VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo;
```

As with most Vulkan structures, the 'sType' field is the structure type, which in this case should be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_QUEUE_CREATE_INFO.
The 'pNext' field is used for extensions and should be set to nullptr when none are used.
The 'flags' field contains flags controlling queue contruction, but no flag is defined for use in the current version of Vulkan, so this field should be set to zero.

The fields of interest here are 'queueFamilyIndex' and 'queueCount'.
The 'queueFamilyIndex' field specifies the family from which you want to allocate queues, and the 'queueCount' field specifies the number of queues to allocate from that family.
To allocate queues from multiple families, simply pass an array of more than one VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure in the 'pQueueCreateInfos' member of the VkDeviceCreateInfo structure.

The queues are contructed when the device is created.
For this reason, we do not "create" queues, but obtain them from the device.
To do this, call vkGetDeviceQueue() :
```
void vkGetDeviceQueue(
	VkDevice				device,
	uint32_t				queueFamilyIndex,
	uint32_t				queueIndex,
	VkQueue*			pQueue
);
```

The 'device' specifies the device from which you want to obtain the queue.
The 'queueFamilyIndex' is the family index.
The 'queueIndex' must refer to a queue that was initialized when the device was created.
If they do, a queue handle is placed into the variable pointed to by 'pQueue'; otherwise, this variable is set to VK_NULL_HANDLE.

2. Creating Command Buffers

The primary purpose of a queue is to process work on behalf of your application.
Work is represented as a sequence of commands that are recorded into 'command buffers'.
Your application will create command buffers containing the work it needs to do and 'submit' them to one of the queues for execution.
Before you can record any commands, you need to create a command buffer.
Command buffers themselves are not created directly, but allocated from pools.
To create a pool, call vkCreateCommandPool(), whose prototype is 
```
VkResult vkCreateCommandPool (
	VkDevice													deivce,
	const VkCommandPoolCreateInfo*			pCreateInfo,
	const VkAllocationCallbacks*					pAllocator,
	VkCommandPool*									pCommandPool
);
```

As with most Vulkan object creation functions, the first parameter, 'device', is the handle to the device that will own the new pool object, 
	and a description of the pool is passed via a  structure, a pointer to which is placed in 'pCreateInfo'.
This structure is an instance of VkCommandPoolCreateInfo, the definition of which is
```
typedef struct VkCommandPoolCreateInfo
{
	VkStructureType							sType;
	const void*									pNext;
	VkCommandPoolCreateFlags		flags;
	uint32_t										queueFamilyIndex;
} VkCommand PoolCreateInfo;
```

As with most Vulkan structures, the first two fields, 'sType' and 'pNext', contain the structure type and a pointer to another structure containing more information about the pool to be created.
Here, we'll set 'sType' to VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_INFO and, because we're not passing any extra information, set 'pNext' to nullptr.

The 'flags' field contains flags that determine the behavior of the pool and the command buffers that are allocated from it.
These are members of the VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits enumeration, and there are currently two flags defined for use here.

```
1. VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT
	Setting this indicates that command buffers taken from the pool will be short-lived and returned to the pool shortly after use.
	Not setting this bit suggests to Vulkan that you might keep the command buffers around for some time.

2. VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT
	Setting this allows individual command buffers to be reused by resetting them or restarting them. (Don't worry, we will cover that in a moment.)
	If this bit is not specified, then only the pool itself can be reset, which implicitly recycles all of the command buffers allocated from it.
```

Each of these bits may add some overhead to the work done by a Vulkan implementation to track the resources or otherwise alter its allocation strategy.
For example, setting VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT may cause a Vulkan implementation to employ a more advanced allocation strategy for the pool in order toavoid fragmentation as command buffers are frequently allocated and then returned to it.
Setting VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT may cause the implementation to track the reset status of each command buffer rather than simply track it at the pool level.

In this case, we're actually going to set both bits.
This gives us the most flexibility, possibly at the expense of some performance in cases where we could have managed command buffers in bulk.

Finally, the 'queueFamilyIndex' field of VkCommandPoolCreateInfo specifies the family of queues to which command buffers allocated from this pool will be submitted.
This is necessary because even where two queues on a device have the same capabilities and support the same set of commands, 
	issuing a particular command to one queue may work differently from ussing that same command to another queue.

The 'pAllocator' parameter is used for application-managed host memory allocations, which is covered in Chapter 2, "Memory and Resources".
Assuming successful creation of the command pool, its handle will be written into the variable pointed to by 'pCommandPool', and vkCreateCommandPool() will return VK_SUCCESS.

Once we have a pool from which to allocate command buffers, we can grab new command buffers by calling vkAllocateCommandBuffers(), which is defined as
```
VkResult vkAllocateCommandBuffers(
	VkDevice														device,
	const VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo*		pAllocateInfo,
	VkCommandBuffer*										pCommandBuffers
);
```

The device used to allocate the command buffers is passed in 'device'.
The remaining parameters describing the command buffers to allocate are passed in an instance of the VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo structure.
The 'address of which is passed in 'pCommandBuffers'.
The definition of the VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo is
```
typedef struct VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo
{
	VkStructureType					sType;
	const void*							pNext;
	VkCommandPool				commandPool
	VkCommandBufferLevel		level;
	uint32_t								commandBufferCount;
} VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo;
```

The 'sType' field should be set to VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_ALLOCATE_INFO.
As we're using only the core feature set here, we set the 'pNext' parameter to nullptr.
A handle to the command pool that we created earlier is placed into the commandPool parameter.

The 'level' parameter specifies the 'level' of the command buffers that we want to allocate.
It can be set to either VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_LEVEL_PRIMARY or VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_LEVEL_SECONDARY.
Vulkan allows 'primary' command buffers to call 'secondary' command buffers.
For our first few examples, we will use only primary-level command buffers.
We'll cover secondary-level command buffers later in the book.

If vkAllocateCommandBuffers() is successful, it will return VK_SUCCESS and place the handles to the allocated command buffers in the array pointed to by pCommandBuffers.
This array should be big enough to hold all the handles.
Of course, if you want to allocate only a single command buffer, you can point this at a regular VkCommandBuffer handle.

To free command buffers, we use the vkFreeCommandBuffers() command, which is declared as 
```
void vkFreeCommandBuffers(
	VkDevice									device,
	VkCommandPool					commandPool,
	uint32_t									commandBufferCount,
	const VkCommandBuffer*		pCommandBuffers
);
```

The 'device' parameter is the device that owns the pool from which the command buffers were allocated.
'commandPool' is a handle to that pool.
The 'commandBufferCount' is the number of command buffers to free.
The 'pCommandBuffers' is a pointer to an array of 'commandBufferCount' handles to the command buffers to free.
Note that freeing a command buffer does not neccessarily free all of the resources associated with it but returns them to the pool from which they were allocated.

To free all of the resources used by a command pool and all of the command buffers allocated from it, call vkDestroyCommandPool(), the prototype of which is 
```
void vkDestroyCommandPool(
	VkDevice										device,
	VkCommandPool						commandPool,
	const VkAllocationCallbacks*		pAllocator
);
```

The device that owns the command pool is passed in the 'device' parameter, and a handle to the command pool to destroy is passed in 'commandPool'.
A pointer to a host memory allocation structure compatible with the one used to create the pool is passed in 'pAllocator'.
This parameter should be nullptr if the 'pAllocator' parameter to vkCreateCommandPool() was also nullptr.

There is no need to explicitly free all of the command buffers allocated from a pool before destroying the pool.
The command buffers allocated from the pool are all greed as a part of destroying the pool and freeing its resources.
Care should be taken, however, that no command buffers allocated from the pool are still executing or queued for execution on the device when vkDestroyingCommandPool() is called.

3. Recycling command buffers
In many applications, a similar sequence of commands is used to render all or part of each frame. 
Therefore, it is likely that you will record similar command buffers over and over. 
Using the commands introduced so far, you would call vkAllocateCommandBuffers() to grab one or more command buffer handles, 
	record commands into the command buffers, and then call vkFreeCommandBuffers() to return the command buffers to their respective pools. 
This is a relatively heavyweight operation, and if you know that you will reuse a command buffer for similar work many times in a row, 
	it may be more efficient to reset the command buffer. 
This effectively puts the command buffer back into its original state but does not necessarily interact with the pool at all. 
Therefore, if the command buffer dynamically allocates resources from the pool as it grows, 
	it can hang on to those resources and avoid the cost of reallocation the second and subsequent times it¡¯s rebuilt. 
	To reset a command buffer, call vkResetCommandBuffer(), the prototype of which is
```
VkResult vkResetCommandBuffer(
	VkCommandBuffer							commandBuffer,
	VkCommandBufferResetFlags		flags
);
```

The command buffer to reset is passed in 'commandBuffer'. 
'flags' specifies additional operations to perform while resetting the command buffer. 
The only flag defined for use here is VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT. 
If this bit is set, then resources allocated from the pool by the command buffer are returned to the pool. 
Even with this bit set, it¡¯s probably still more efficient to call vkResetCommandBuffer() than it is to free and reallocate a new command buffer.

It¡¯s also possible to reset all the command buffers allocated from a pool in one shot. 
To do this, call vkResetCommandPool(), the prototype of which is
```
VkResult vkResetCommandPool(
	VkDevice										device,
	VkCommandPool						commandPool,
	VkCommandPoolResetFlags		flags
);
```

The device that owns the command pool is specified in device, and the pool to reset is specified in commandPool. 
Just as with vkResetCommandBuffer(), the flags parameter specifies additional action to be taken as part of resetting the pool. 
Again, the only flag defined for use here is VK_COMMAND_POOL_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT. 
When this bit is set, any resources dynamically allocated by the pool are freed as part of the reset operation.

Command buffers allocated from the pool are not freed by vkResetCommandPool(), but all reenter their initial state as if they had been freshly allocated. 
vkResetCommandPool() is typically used at the end of a frame to return a batch of reusable command buffers to their pool rather than individually reset individual command buffers.

Care should be taken to try to keep the complexity of command buffers consistent over their multiple uses if they are reset without returning resources to the pool. 
As a command buffer grows, it may allocate resources dynamically from the pool, and the command pool may allocate resources from a systemwide pool. 
The amount of resources that a command buffer may consume is essentially unbounded, 
	because there is no hard-wired limit to the number of commands you can place in a single command buffer. 
If your application uses a mix of very small and very large command buffers, it¡¯s possible that eventually all command buffers will grow as large as the most complex command buffers.

To avoid this scenario,	
	either periodically specify the VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT or VK_COMMAND_POOL_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT 
	when resetting command buffers or their pools, respectively, 
	or try to ensure that the same command buffers are always used in the same way-either short, simple command buffers or long, complex command buffers. Avoid mixing use cases.

4. Submission of commands
To execute the command buffer on the device, we need to submit it to one of the device¡¯s queues. 
To do this, call vkQueueSubmit(), the prototype of which is
```
VkResult vkQueueSubmit (
	VkQueue							queue,
	uint32_t							submitCount,
	const VkSubmitInfo*		pSubmits,
	VkFence							fence
);
```

This command can submit one or more command buffers to the device for execution. 
The 'queue' parameter specifies the device queue to which to send the command buffer. 
Access to the queue must be externally synchronized. 
All of the command buffers to submit were allocated from a pool, and that pool must have been created with respect to one of the device¡¯s queue families. 
This is the queueFamilyIndex member of the VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure passed to vkCreateCommandPool(). 
'queue' must be a member of that family.

The number of submissions is specified in 'submitCount', and an array of structures describing each of the submissions is specified in 'pSubmits'. 
Each submission is represented by an instance of the VkSubmitInfo structures, the definition of which is
```
typedef struct VkSubmitInfo
{
	VkStructureType							sType;
	const void*									pNext;
	uint32_t										waitSemaphoreCount;
	const VkSemaphore*					pWaitSemaphores;
	const VkPipelineStageFlags*		pWaitDstStageMask;
	uint32_t										commandBufferCount;
	const VkCommandBuffer*			pCommandBuffers;
	uint32_t										signalSemaphoreCount;
	const VkSemaphore*					pSignalSemaphores;
} VkSubmitInfo;
```

The sType field of VkSubmitInfo should be set to VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SUBMIT_INFO, and pNext should be set to nullptr. 
Each VkSubmitInfo structure can represent multiple command buffers that are to be executed by the device.

Each set of command buffers can be wrapped in a set of semaphores upon which to wait before beginning execution 
	and can signal one or more semaphores when they complete execution. 
A semaphore is a type of synchronization primitive that allows work executed by different queues to be scheduled and coordinated correctly. 
We will cover semaphores along with other synchronization primitives in Chapter 11, ¡°Synchronization.¡± 
For now, we¡¯re not going to use these fields, 
	so waitSemaphoreCount and signalSemaphoreCount can be set to zero, and pWaitSemaphores, pWaitDstStageMask, and pSignalSemaphores can all be set to nullptr.

The command buffers we want to execute are placed in an array, and its address is passed in pCommandBuffers. 
The number of command buffers to execute (the length of the pCommandBuffers array) is specified in commandBufferCount. 
At some time after the vkQueueSubmit() command is called, the commands in the command buffers begin executing on the device. 
Commands submitted to different queues on the same device (or to queues belonging to different devices) may execute in parallel. 
vkQueueSubmit() returns as soon as the specified command buffers have been scheduled, possibly long before they¡¯ve even begun executing.

The fence parameter to vkQueueSubmit() is a handle to a fence object, which can be used to wait for completion of the commands executed by this submission. 
A fence is another type of synchronization primitive that we will cover in Chapter 11, ¡°Synchronization.¡± 
For now, we¡¯ll set fence to VK_NULL_HANDLE. 
Until we cover fences, we can wait for all work submitted to a queue to complete by calling vkQueueWaitIdle(). 
Its prototype is
```
VkResult vkQueueWaitIdle(
	VkQueue		queue
);
```

A shortcut to wait for all commands submitted to all queues on a single device to have completed is to call vkDeviceWaitIdle(). Its prototype is
```
VkResult vkDeviceWaitIdle (
	VkDevice		device
);
```

Calling vkQueueWaitIdle() or vkDeviceWaitIdle() is really not recommended, as they fully flush any work on the queue or device and are very heavyweight operations.
Neither should be called in any performance-critical part of your application. 
Suitable use cases include just before shutting down the application or when reinitializing application subsystems 
	such as thread management, memory management, and so on, where there is likely to be a substantial pause anyway.

Summary
This chapter introduced you to command buffers, which are the mechanisms by which commands are communicated by your application to the Vulkan device. 
We introduced our first Vulkan command and showed you how to ask the device to execute work for you.

We discussed how to send the command buffers to the Vulkan device for execution by submitting them to the queue. 
You saw how to ensure that all work submitted to a queue or to a device has finished executing. 
Although we glossed over a number of important topics, 
	such as how to call one command buffer from another and how to implement fine-grained synchronization between the host and the device and between queues on the device, 
	these topics will be discussed in upcoming chapters.
